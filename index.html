			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div id=main-content>
			<p> <img src="assets/images/i-see-you.jpg"> My name is Michael Sanchez. I grew up in Hacienda Heights, playing guitar and sports. After working for a number of years in the Music Industry I am ready to expand my skills and try something new. I hope that I can keep up with the class and be able to offer something of value to my cohorts.</p>

			<p>I have had the opportunitly as a musician to play in front of large crowds. As a touring front of house engineer and studio engineer I've worked with some fun and interesting people. I currently work with some amazing and talented musicians at USC... they can be really challenging at times, hahaha! </p>
